Tasks: 
 write a loop to drive the room pathing, while there are still rooms to explore
 while the length of visited rooms is less than the amount of rooms in the world

conditional statement to check to make sure room move is valid, there is an exit and the room is not visited

find a way to reference methods from room.py

make sure to create a variable for edges called "path" for storing exits

 check to make sure if there are still ways to travel,
         -1 to target the end of the list because its a stack

insert the element to the top of the stack
    then player will move next

append the path move to the traversal path

back-tracking if there is a dead end

pop and remove the top item from the stack
